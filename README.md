# ChunkLoader
A horrendous PM plugin to manually load all the chunks in your world without logging on. Only for the sole purpose of aiding in PM4 -> DF world conversion.

## How to use
Load in `plugins` directory, edit the `config.yml` to the world you wanna manually load and enjoy!

## Disclaimer
I do not advocate for the use of PM as it causes severe, irreversable brain damage. This tool was made SOLELY for aiding in the coversion of PM4 worlds -> DF. **PLEASE** use dragonfly to conserve neurons in your brain.
